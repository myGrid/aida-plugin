Updating version in Taverna, things to check :

1. Change version numbers in pom.xml, taverna.infrastructure usually changes for major, and other minor versions.
   Look into the new release of taverna, save a perspective and check for the component's version

2. Also update these files (according to 1): 
	src/main/resources/aida-perspective.xml 
   	src/main/resources/org/vle/aid/taverna/aida-perspective.xml 

3. Create a new file : aid-<new-version>.xml put it on tomcat-dev/webapps/repository
   Create this by copying previous version and updating the necessary version number.

4. Add an entry of this new version to pluginlist.xml on tomcat-dev/webapps/repository

5. mvn clean install deploy
